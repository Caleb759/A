        <h3 class="paragraph">Pests, such as insects, rodents, that interfere with human activities
            by damaging crops, spreading disease, or invading homes and buildings.
            They can pose serious health risks, harm food supplies, and cause significant economic losses.
            Managing pests often involves a combination of prevention, control, and elimination methods,
            but improper use of chemicals or lack of sustainable practices can lead to environmental damage and pest resistance.</h3>
